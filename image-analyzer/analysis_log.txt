Prompt: Describe this image
Result: This image features a monkey hanging from a banana tree, with only its torso and legs visible. Its fur appears to be a mix of white and gray, with a distinctive, fuzzy white patch on its belly. The monkey seems to be grasping a banana in its left hand, while its arm is raised above its head as if it is holding onto a branch or fruit. The monkey's facial expression is not clearly discernible due to the image's blurriness. The image has been altered to appear as if the monkey is hanging in a tree, with a thin line resembling a branch extending from the monkey's hand. In the background, lush greenery is visible, although it is out of focus. A watermark reading "mobiledaily.com" is visible in the bottom-right corner of the image.
